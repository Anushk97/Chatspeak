Towards a Deep and Unified Understanding of Deep Neural ...,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/guan19a.html,We define a unified information-based measure to provide quantitative explanations on how intermediate layers of deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) ...
Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/houlsby19a.html,"Abstract. Fine-tuning large pretrained models is an effective transfer mechanism in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is ..."
Blessing of Class Diversity in Pre-training,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/zhao23a.html,This paper presents a new statistical analysis aiming to explain the recent superior achievements of the pre-training techniques in natural language processing ...
Describing Differences between Text Distributions with ...,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/zhong22a/zhong22a.pdf,"We propose to automatically describe the differences by “learning a natural lan- guage hypothesis”: given two distributions D0 and D1, we search for a ..."
Towards a Deep and Unified Understanding of Deep Neural ...,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/guan19a/guan19a.pdf,"By examining these issues, we move towards a deep (aware of intermediate layers) and unified (coherent) understanding of neural models. We use models in NLP as ..."
Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/houlsby19a/houlsby19a.pdf,"Transfer from pre-trained models yields strong performance on many NLP tasks (Dai & Le, 2015; Howard & Ruder,. 2018; Radford et al., 2018). BERT, a Transformer ..."
NLP From Scratch Without Large-Scale Pretraining,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/yao22c/yao22c.pdf,"Pretrained language models have become the stan- dard approach for many NLP tasks due to strong performance, but they are very expensive to train."
Controlled Text Generation with Natural Language Instructions,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23g.html,We annotate natural texts through a combination of off-the-shelf NLP tools and simple heuristics with the linguistic and extra-linguistic constraints they ...
Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation ...,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/jia21b.html,A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the ...
TOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURE IN NATURAL LANGUAGE DATA,https://proceedings.mlr.press/v196/fitz22a/fitz22a.pdf,"This paper presents a novel method, based on the ideas from algebraic topology, for the analysis of raw natural language text. The paper introduces the ..."
