Automatic differentiation in ML: Where we are and ... - NIPS,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8092-automatic-differentiation-in-ml-where-we-are-and-where-we-should-be-going.pdf,"We review the current state of automatic differentiation (AD) for array program- ming in machine learning (ML), including the different approaches such as ..."
Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf,Here we examine several ways that the resulting erosion of boundaries may significantly increase technical debt in ML systems. Entanglement. Machine learning ...
Improving Online Algorithms via ML Predictions - NIPS,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8174-improving-online-algorithms-via-ml-predictions,Abstract. In this work we study the problem of using machine-learned predictions to improve performance of online algorithms. We consider two classical problems ...
Measures of distortion for machine learning - NIPS,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7737-measures-of-distortion-for-machine-learning,"In this paper, we show that many of the existing distortion measures behave in an undesired way, when considered from a machine learning point of view. We ..."
Machine Learning for Variance Reduction in Online ...,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/488b084119a1c7a4950f00706ec7ea16-Paper.pdf,"We propose a machine learning regression-adjusted treatment effect estimator, which we call MLRATE. MLRATE uses machine learning predictors of the outcome to ..."
Making AI Forget You: Data Deletion in Machine Learning,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8611-making-ai-forget-you-data-deletion-in-machine-learning.pdf,"For many standard ML models, the only way to completely remove an individual's data is to retrain the whole model from scratch on the remaining data, which is ..."
