Large-scale zero-shot image classification from rich and diverse textual descriptions,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09669,We study the impact of using rich and diverse textual descriptions of classes for zero-shot learning (ZSL) on ImageNet. We create a new dataset ImageNet-Wiki that matches each …
Visual-semantic consistency matching network for generalized zero-shot learning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231223002278,Generalized zero-shot learning aims to classify samples of seen and unseen classes by providing only the labels of seen classes. Most GZSL methods directly associate seen …
Semantics disentangling for generalized zero-shot learning,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chen_Semantics_Disentangling_for_Generalized_Zero-Shot_Learning_ICCV_2021_paper.html,Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to classify samples under the assumption that some classes are not observable during training.
