Attribute attention for semantic disambiguation in zero-shot learning,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Liu_Attribute_Attention_for_Semantic_Disambiguation_in_Zero-Shot_Learning_ICCV_2019_paper.html,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to accurately recognize unseen objects by learning mapping matrices that bridge the gap between visual information and semantic attributes. Previous …
Ams-sfe: Towards an alignment of manifold structures via semantic feature expansion for zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8784887/,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims at recognizing unseen classes with knowledge transferred from seen classes. This is typically achieved by exploiting a semantic feature space (FS) …
Leveraging balanced semantic embedding for generative zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9927312/,Generative (generalized) zero-shot learning [(G) ZSL] models aim to synthesize unseen class features by using only seen class feature and attribute pairs as training data. However …
Integrating topology beyond descriptions for zero-shot learning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320323004363,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to discriminate object categories through the identification of their attributes and has received much attention for its capability to predict unseen …
Dual-uncertainty Guided Cycle-consistent Network for Zero-shot Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10113664/,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to identify novel categories via transferring shared semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Since labeled samples of novel categories …
Towards effective deep embedding for zero-shot learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9051798/,"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) can be formulated as a cross-domain matching problem: after being projected into a joint embedding space, a visual sample will match against all …"
Adversarial zero-shot learning with semantic augmentation,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11886,"In situations in which labels are expensive or difficult to obtain, deep neural networks for object recognition often suffer to achieve fair performance. Zero-shot learning is dedicated to …"
